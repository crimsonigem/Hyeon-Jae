## Modeling and Simulations

###### Small Systems Analysis
The production pathways of the different biomaterials that we will be testing (Curli Fibers, Spider Silk, Elastin, Collagen, resilin, Cellulose, Chitosan, Alginate) can be modeled using the laws of Mass Action and Michaelis-Menten Kinetics (for enzyme catalyzed reactions).

This will involve identifying all reactions and interactions involved in the pathway, as well as finding the corresponding reaction coefficients in literature. Once we have our system of differential equations, these can be solved using any computing program.

The 2015 Oxford iGEM team provides a good tutorial on this topic: http://2015.igem.org/Team:Oxford/Modeling/Tutorial

###### Large Systems Modeling (more ambitious)
Genome scale modeling can be used to understand cell responses to metabolic burden.

The iJO1366 model of the K-12 MG1655 *E. coli* strain created by [Orth et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261703/) can be used as a starting point for generating a genome-scale reconstruction of the strain relevant to our project, LSR10.

Relevant tools in conducting a flux balance analysis are Cobrapy and Escher. Furthermore, the pathways involved in our project can be visualized by importing the genome scale (COBRA) model into EXPASY.
