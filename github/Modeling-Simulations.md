## Modeling and Simulations

#### Systems Models
###### Gene Circuit Models
Mass Action
Michaelis-Menten Kinetics

The iJO1366 model of the K-12 MG1655 *E. coli* strain created by [Orth et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261703/) can be used as a starting point for generating a genome-scale reconstruction of the strain relevant to our project, LSR10.

###### Pathway Modeling
Flux Balance Analysis (Cobrapy, escher)
The pathways involved in our project can be visualized by importing the genome scale (COBRA) model into EXPASY.

###### Systems Flux Balance Analysis
The COBRA toolbox can be used to conduct a flux balance analysis of the COBRA model of LSR10.
