#### Week 3 (June 18 - June 23)

##### Overview
Much of the week was spent preparing for NEGEM and Hack Life, a biohackathon, both of which took place this week. These were both highly valuable experiences in learning and practicing our presentation skills, and were a good chance to start preparing for the Jamboree presentation that we will take place in the fall.

##### NEGEM
The following are some of the points that I took away from both the preparation and presentation for NEGEM:
1. The "narrative" that ties the project together is crucial for an easily understood and effective presentation.
2. People will not absorb details if it is only mentioned briefly in passing.
3. Avoid technical terminology, and instead focus on key ideas. This point was especially applicable in explaining the curli production pathway, which involves a number of proteins. Instead of describing the role of each protein involved in the pathway, it was more effective to

4. Clearly identifying the potential applications of the project is crucial for leaving a positive impression on the audience.

##### Hack Life
Here I will summarize my takeaways from the presentation on bioethics and safety that my team gave at the biohackathon:
1. Most people instinctively know that the introduction of genetically modified organisms into new environments poses a degree of risk.
2. Although the term "kill switch" may be rather mainstream, most people do not know how to implement one and when it is most appropriate.

##### Experimental Pathway Optimization
When not preparing for or participating in the two events discussed above, Erin, Francis, and I designed a protocol for experimentally optimizing the curli production pathway. 

The optimization process will involve several successive rounds, in the following order:
1. Maximize the amount of csgA produced for an arbitrarily chosen expression level of the Sec complex and other csg proteins.
2. Determine the minimum level of csgG needed at the maximum level of csgA determined in step 1.
3. Determine the minimum level of csgE needed at the csgA and csgG levels determined above.
4. Repeat step 3 for csgC.
5. Repeat step 3 for the Sec complex.
6. Iterate steps 2-5 several times until results are constant.

This experiment makes several assumptions:
1. The only proteins in the Sec complex that are absolutely crucial for full function are SecY, SecE, and SecG, which form the membrane channel, and SecA, which is the ATPase that powers the channel.
2. Each of the proteins listed in the first assumption are in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.
3. Once we determine the optimal ratios between csgA, csgG, csgE, csgC, and the Sec complex, the entire system can be scaled up by making adjustments to the promoter that governs the entire operon.

Furthermore, these experiments will help inform the pathway model of the curli production pathway.
