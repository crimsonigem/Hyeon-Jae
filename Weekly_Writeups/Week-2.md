### Week 2

##### Overview
The majority of the week was spent fleshing out the gene circuit model for the csg production pathway. This involved looking more closely at the relevant parameters, attempting to find some of the rate constants, and simplifying the model as much as possible. I started working with Erin this week, which proved to be an excellent decision, as I was able to make significantly more progress when I had someone to discuss my work with.

Numerous questions arose along the way that have still not been answered, so I will list some of them here.

##### Model Updates
1. We have decided to treat csgE and csgG as a combined complex in a  "black box", assuming a 1:1 ratio between the two in the production pathway
2. We will take rates of polymerization into account in all areas of the cell

##### Lingering Questions
1. How do protein degradation rates vary in the different parts of the cell? (i.e. cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular matrix)
2. Is it plausible to differentiate between nucleation, creation of oligomers, and fiber elongation in each section of the cell?
3. What is the best way to determine the concentration of the csg operon in the cell?
4. What are the effects of the barcode and riboswitch on mRNA stability?
5. Is transcriptional polarity only an issue when the cell is under some form of stress? Would a cell overproducing csg be considered under stress?
